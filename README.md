The Campus Access Control System is an implementation aimed at minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and enhancing the quality of academic life. This system not only strengthens security by restricting access to campus areas but also facilitates detailed monitoring of academic activities.

The university provides students with a smart access card used to enter specific areas of the campus, such as course halls, laboratories, libraries, cafeterias, dormitories, and more. The system includes special zones like course halls and labs, where the number of hours spent is tracked daily and per semester. Access to these zones is granted only if the student's schedule permits.
